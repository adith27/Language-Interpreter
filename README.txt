Windows Instructions
--------------------

1.
Move the whole folder containing this file (Hw6) to a folder of
your choice. Here we assume that you have put it on the Desktop.

2.
To generate and compile the lexer and parser for the PLC language, run
the Command Prompt application. At the prompt, enter the following commands,
one at time:

   cd H:\Desktop\Hw6
   bin\fslex --unicode PlcLexer.fsl
   bin\fsyacc --module PlcParser PlcParser.fsy

This assumes that your Desktop folder is in drive H, which is the case for the
CS Windows server. If it is in another drive, use the name of that drive instead.

3.
To use the parser inside F# interactive, see main.fsx
